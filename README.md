## Description

The Pig Game is a fun, two-player dice game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Players take turns rolling a dice. During each turn, a player can either:
- **Roll the Dice**: Add the rolled number to their current score unless they roll a 1, which forfeits their turn.
- **Hold**: Add their current score to their total score and pass the turn to the next player.

The first player to reach a total score of 100 wins the game!

## How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice** 🎲:
   - Click the "Roll Dice" button to roll.
   - If the result is not a 1, the number is added to the current score.
